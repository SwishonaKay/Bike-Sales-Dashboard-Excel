# Bike Sales Dashboard - Data Analysis and Visualization

## Project Overview
This dashboard provides an interactive visualization of bike sales performance data, helping business stakeholders track key metrics relating to customers such as age, marital status, gender, income, education, occupation, commute distance, etc.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Filters:** Users can filter data by region, marital status and education.
- **Key Metrics:** Average income of customer, customer commute distance,customer’s age.
- **Visualizations:** Bar charts for average income per purchase, line graphs for customer commute and customer age range.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is a sample bike sales dataset from [Github](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Excel-Tutorial/blob/main/Excel%20Project%20Dataset.xlsx).

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Tools:** Microsoft Excel (PivotTables, Slicers, Conditional Formatting).
- **Techniques:** Data cleaning, data modeling, and visualization.

## Steps to Use the Dashboard
1. Download the Excel file from the repository.
2. Open the file in Microsoft Excel.
3. Remove duplicate data
4.Format gender and marital status column, changing “M” to “Male”, “F” to “Female”, “M” to “Married” and “S” to “Single”.
5. Inserted pivot tables.
5. Use the slicers on the right side to filter data by region, marital status, or education.
6. Explore the visualizations to analyze customer data.

## Insights and Analysis
- **Insight 1:** The average income of males and females who purchased bikes across all three regions were generally higher than those who did not.This indicates that higher income levels is a key factor influencing bike purchases, and marketing efforts can be tailor to target higher-income demographics.

- **Insight 2:** Adolescents and older individuals purchased bikes the least across all three regions. The analysis revealed that middle-aged individuals were the most likely to purchase bikes. This suggests that marketing efforts and product designs could be optimized to cater to the preferences and needs of middle-aged customers.

## Challenges and Solutions
One challenge was dealing with visualizing age data because the wide range of ages made the chart cluttered and hard to read. To solve this, you used IF statements to group the ages into meaningful ranges and then plotted these grouped ranges instead. This made the chart cleaner and more interpretable.
